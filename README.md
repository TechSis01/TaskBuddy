# TaskBuddy
I reached a point where I was unsure about the Personal Project I wanted to build. Like every other day, I surfed the web and I came on Hashnode to publish an article from my drafts, the first thing that caught my attention was the Appwrite Hackathon post. Instantly, my interest was piqued, and I eagerly sought out more information. After thoroughly reviewing the guidelines and the list of sample Applications that could be developed, I decided to try out a Task Management Application.
I face significant challenges with time management, task allocation, and task completion. Despite attempting to create to-do lists on my Notes, it proves ineffective as I struggle to keep track of my tasks, resulting in a chaotic situation. I was in dire need of a user-friendly application that could assist me in seamlessly managing and monitoring my task at every stage.

Choosing the task management application was a no-brainer for me. I knew immediately that I would definitely use it once I finished building it. Plus, I strongly believe there are many others out there who are in the same boat, eagerly searching for an easy-to-use solution to effectively accomplish their goals.

Currently, I was only able to implement features 1-5. I had to pause building this project several times because I was dealing with my final year in university, getting back to implement the features was a struggle, I hope to do that in the future.
