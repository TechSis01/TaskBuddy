# TaskBuddy
##Introduction
I reached a point where I was unsure about the Personal Project I wanted to build. Like every other day, I surfed the web and I came on Hashnode to publish an article from my drafts, the first thing that caught my attention was the Appwrite Hackathon post. Instantly, my interest was piqued, and I eagerly sought out more information. After thoroughly reviewing the guidelines and the list of sample Applications that could be developed, I decided to build a Task Management Application.
I face significant challenges with time management, task allocation, and task completion. Despite attempting to create to-do lists on my Notes, it proves ineffective as I struggle to keep track of my tasks, resulting in a chaotic situation. I was in dire need of a user-friendly application that could assist me in seamlessly managing and monitoring my tasks at every stage.

## Development Tools
* React - A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables the creation of complex and interactive web applications with reusable UI components.
* Tailwind CSS - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs without leaving your HTML. Tailwind CSS provides low-level utility classes that help you build completely custom designs without writing CSS.
* React Icons - This library includes popular icons in your React projects. It utilizes ES6 imports to include icons from a wide range of popular icon sets for easy scalability and maintainability in React applications.
* React Big Calendar - An events calendar component for React. It provides views for month, week, day, and agenda, allowing easy management and display of events and schedules.
* Appwrite - An open-source backend server that abstracts the complexity of common developer tasks. Appwrite provides a set of RESTful APIs to manage authentication, databases, cloud storage, and more, simplifying the backend development process.
